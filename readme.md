# Log History
Following an idea of Heinz von FÃ¶rster, this is a logarithmic plot of all history for better personal understanding.

## Use
Edit the data.csv or periods csv and plot it again locally using jupyter-lab, or [use google colab to edit the appearance and data online](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hrtlacek/logHistory/blob/main/history.ipynb).


 ## Example Plot
